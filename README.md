Getting Started:
<!-- https://ongcangco.github.io/slotsmachine/ -->
-Play until you reach a new highscore and make the leaderboard!
-Simple basic concepts. You are able to select whatever category you would like to test your knowledge on and see how you match up in rankings.

Icebox Items:
-Plenty of icebox features, wanted to have so much more in here.
-Would have loved to be able to customize the trivia a whole lot more. I wanted to have a difficulty setting and a number of questions setting.
-Wanted to be able to put a timer for each questions as well.
-Definitely would like to add sounds to the buttons when clicked, and when you obtain a new high score. 


Biggest Challenge:
-Organizing the pages. I think I lost a whole day in just getting my rendering to work as I did not set my pages up very well.
-Had a tough time implementing user features for my score page. 
-Organization skills overall was a big downfall for me. 

Takeaways:
-There's always so much more to learn, and these mistakes will make you learn a lot more than you think.
